    Enter the name of the room to which notifications should be sent. Note that this can be either the name of the 
    room OR the id number, e.g. "Dev Team", and that multiple names may appear comma separated.  
    While names are more readable, room numbers will not change over time and are therefore more resilient.
    Use your <b>admin</b> token to get a list of room ids <a href="https://api.hipchat.com/v1/rooms/list?auth_token=ADMINTOKEN">here</a>.

    You can customize the room name per-project, but should always enter a default here.
