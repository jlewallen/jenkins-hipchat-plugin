<div>
    <p>Specify a <a href="http://mustache.github.com/" target="_blank">Mustache</a> template that will be appended to the end of the
        Build Started and Build Completed templates.</p>

    <p>This can be used when you want a global base default template but just want to configure the last part of a
    template on a per-job basis.  This is particularly useful when you want to include build parameters in the status
    messages.</p>

    <p>The variables available to this template is the same as for the template it is appended to (eg. Start or Complete).  Of particular
    use might be build parameters which are available via <em>build.buildVariables</em>
    (eg. <em>build.buildVariables.ENVIRONMENT</em>)</p>
