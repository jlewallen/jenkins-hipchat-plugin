    Enter the room names to which notifications should be sent. Note that this can include names of
    rooms OR room id numbers, e.g. "Dev Team", and that multiple values may appear comma separated.
    While names are more readable, room numbers will not change over time and are therefore more resilient.
    Use your <b>admin</b> token to get a list of room ids <a href="https://api.hipchat.com/v1/rooms/list?auth_token=ADMINTOKEN">here</a>.
